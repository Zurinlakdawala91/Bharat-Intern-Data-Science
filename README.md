# Task 2 - Titanic Classification

# AIM:

The sinking of the Titanic on April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage, is a tragic and well-known historical event. The collision with an iceberg resulted in the loss of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew members. The disaster had a profound impact on global safety regulations for ships.

While chance played a role in survival, it has been observed that certain groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

As part of this challenge, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can answer the question: "What characteristics made people more likely to survive?" The dataset provided contains passenger data, including attributes like name, age, gender, and socio-economic class.

You are tasked with utilizing this dataset from Kaggle to create a predictive model that can identify the factors associated with survival during the Titanic tragedy. The project presents an opportunity to gain insights into historical events and apply data analysis and machine learning techniques to understand the determinants of survival on the Titanic.

It is important to approach this challenge with sensitivity and respect for the victims and their families, given the historical significance of the event.
